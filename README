INSTALLATION
---------------------
create a symbolic link in your HOME

ln -s <path to your cloned repo>/bash_profile .bash_profile

AUTOCOMPLETION
---------------------
For autocompletion, you need the file git-completion.sh, in normal git installations
it can be found in: 

/usr/local/git/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash

if it is there, leave it there, the bash_profile must work properly
if not, you must download it from the oficial git repository:

https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash

and then intall it in the folder described above, or modify bash_profile
